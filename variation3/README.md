## Variation 3

A business is looking for workers for N different jobs. There are exactly N candidates and each applicant told us which jobs they are qualified and how much salary would be asked. The boss of the business wants to recruit all the candidates and make all the jobs done, but up to an amount S.

Let value of F[i,j] is zero (=0) if the applicant i is not good at job j, and it is positive (>0) if he is good at this job and the value means the salary.

The cost constantly rising with mandating any new employee, and we take advantage of it in the solution.
